# GX Core
## Criar Expectativas, validar dados e revisar Resultados de Validação

Following the guidance of my advisor on Software Quality and Testing, where we explored new testing tools and evaluated the full power of these tools

This repository was created for those, like me, who want to learn a little more about Great Expectations' Gx Core data validation tool.

A book rich in opinions on various tools that exist for Software and Data Quality and Testing will soon be available.
